ao3.py
======

This is a forked version of `ao3 <https://github.com/alexwlchan/ao3>` Python package, that provides a scripted interface to some of the data on
`AO3 <https://archiveofourown.org/>`_ (the Archive of Our Own).

This version extends pseudo-API, and fixes some annoying bugs that I found when using it for development.

It is **not** an official API.
